        <h2> report about my experience using css and html for this web development assignment</h2>
      <p>
        over this course i have learned the basics of web development and how to use html and css i have personally enjoyed coding it was much easier than javascript and i wouldve been able to fit more in if i did not procastinate
        i faced many challenged using the grid methid and tried to get my code to look normal and functional 
        through trial errir and rewatching our lectures on multiple occasions i was able to improve signicantly 
        debugging was extremly time consuming as its easy to make one mistake using html amd they wont say nothing using css to make my site mobile friendly was also hard
      </p>
      <P>
        my main focus was staying true to myself and creating something fun while implamenting the checklist i chose pink and 'segoe ui' because i enjoyed it and include hello kitty pics that i found fun for me and i truly hope you enjoy 
      </P>
      <p>
        valadating my html annd css was crucial because it helped me undertsand why my work was breaking r not showing up how i wanted it too
        in my video demonstartion i explain how i built each part of the code and where i faced my challanges
      </p>
      <p>
        over all i enjoyed this project and i have more confidence in htmk and css and will continue to practice and be ready for second year
      </p>
